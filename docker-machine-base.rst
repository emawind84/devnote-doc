Get Started With Docker & Docker Machine
=============================================

How to install Docker and how to use Docker Machine to manage Docker instances
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The easy way is to not install Docker, just let Docker Machine do the job, in order to do that
install Docker Machine.

.. important::
  First of all let's remove stupid issue with Windows bash console and trailing slash 
  that I do not want to cover, in order to resolve this issue we will use **Linux machine only**. 

From an Linux console install Docker Machine with the following commands::

    $ curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.9.0/docker-machine-`uname \
      -s`-`uname -m` >/tmp/docker-machine &&
    chmod +x /tmp/docker-machine &&
    sudo cp /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

Take some scripts from our Github account, that will be useful later::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sangahco/docker-machine-cli.git
    $ cd docker-machine-cli
    $ chmod a+x *.sh


In order to manage Amazon EC2 Instances set two environment variables,
these two keys are generated by Amazon service in order to send request to their API::

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=myaccesskey
    export AWS_SECRET=mysecretkey

for more info read this: https://aws.amazon.com/developers/access-keys/

You can put the previous code inside the ``.bashrc`` file inside the user home folder
and than update the user environment with the following command::

    $ source ~/.bashrc


Create Amazon EC2 Machine (Docker Host)
--------------------------------------------

    $ /bin/sh create-aws-machine.sh <MACHINE NAME>


List Available Machines
----------------------------------

    $ docker-machine ls


Connect to EC2 Machine (Docker Host)
---------------------------------------

Connect to a machine with the following command, 
replacing ``aws1`` with the machine name from the previous command::

    $ docker-machine env aws1
    $ eval $(docker-machine env aws1)


Check Active Machine
----------------------------

    $ docker-machine active


Stop Machine
-------------------

    $ docker-machine stop aws1


Remove (Terminate) Machine
--------------------------------

.. important:: This command will terminate the instance and will be removed from the Amazon EC2

::

    $ docker-machine rm aws1
